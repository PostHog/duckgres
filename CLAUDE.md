# Claude Code Context for Duckgres

This file provides context for Claude Code sessions working on this codebase.

## Project Overview

Duckgres is a PostgreSQL wire protocol server backed by DuckDB. It allows any PostgreSQL client (psql, pgAdmin, lib/pq, psycopg2, JDBC, etc.) to connect and execute queries against DuckDB databases.

## Architecture

Duckgres has three deployment topologies, built from three run modes (`standalone`, `control-plane`, `duckdb-service`):

**1. Standalone** — single process. One binary running in `standalone` mode handles the PG wire protocol, auth, TLS, transpilation, and DuckDB execution itself. Each user gets their own DuckDB database in-process.
```
PG Client → TLS → Server (standalone) → DuckDB
```

**2. Control plane + local process workers** — single host, multiple processes. A `control-plane` parent process owns client connections (TLS, auth, PG wire, transpilation) and spawns child `duckdb-service` worker processes, communicating via Arrow Flight SQL over Unix sockets. Used for stronger isolation between sessions on a single host. Selected with `--worker-backend process` (the default).
```
PG Client → TLS/Auth/PG Protocol → Control Plane (process)
                                 → Flight SQL (UDS) → local Worker process (DuckDB)
```

**3. Control plane + remote workers on Kubernetes** — multitenant cluster deployment. The `control-plane` runs as its own pod and routes per-org traffic to dedicated `duckdb-service` worker pods over TCP+TLS. Worker pods are scheduled by the control plane via the K8s API; org config and worker state are persisted in a Postgres-backed config store. Selected with `--worker-backend remote`; requires a binary built with `-tags kubernetes`.
```
PG Client → TLS/Auth/PG Protocol → Control Plane pod
                                 → Flight SQL (TCP+TLS) → per-org Worker pod (DuckDB)
```

In topologies 2 and 3, the control plane also exposes an Arrow Flight SQL ingress (`--flight-port`) for clients that prefer Flight over the PG wire protocol.

### Key Components

- **main.go / config_resolution.go**: CLI flags; effective config resolution (CLI > env > YAML > defaults), including env-only K8s knobs.
- **server/** — PG wire protocol server and DuckDB execution
  - Wire protocol & connections: `server.go`, `conn.go`, `conn_errors.go`, `conn_query_exec.go`, `conn_results.go`, `conn_copy.go`, `conn_extended_query.go`, `conn_pg_stat_activity.go`, `conn_cursor.go`, `protocol.go`, `exports.go`
  - Execution: `executor.go`, `flight_executor.go`, `chsql.go`, `transient.go`
  - Catalog & types: `catalog.go`, `types.go`, `session_database_metadata.go`
  - Auth, TLS, rate limiting: `auth_policy.go`, `ratelimit.go`, `certs.go`, `acme.go`
  - DuckLake: `ducklake_migration.go`, `checkpoint.go`
  - Observability: `querylog.go`, `tracing.go`
  - ProcessIsolation child workers: `parent.go`, `worker.go`, `worker_activation.go`, `worker_control.go`
  - Flight SQL ingress (shared with control plane): `flightsqlingress/`
- **controlplane/** — Multi-process / multi-tenant control plane
  - Core: `control.go`, `session_mgr.go`, `worker_mgr.go`, `worker_pool.go` (process/k8s abstraction), `validation.go`, `sdnotify.go`
  - Flight SQL ingress adapter: `flight_ingress.go`
  - Runtime loops: `janitor.go`, `leader_loop.go`, `memory_rebalancer.go`, `runtime_tracker.go`
  - K8s / multitenant under build tag `kubernetes` (including: `multitenant.go`, `k8s_pool.go`, `k8s_pool_acquire.go`, `k8s_pool_spawn.go`, `k8s_pool_lifecycle.go`, `k8s_pool_reconcile.go`, `k8s_pool_helpers.go`, `k8s_factory.go`, `org_router.go`, `org_reserved_pool.go`, `sts_broker.go`, `shared_worker_activator.go`, `worker_rpc_security.go`, `janitor_leader_k8s.go`)
  - Subpackages: `admin/` (HTTP admin API + dashboard, `kubernetes` tag; includes the models explorer UI `static/models.html` + `models_api.go`, and `devserver/` for local UI dev against a port-forwarded CP — see `admin/README.md`), `provisioner/` (k8s controller, `kubernetes` tag), `provisioning/` (HTTP API), `configstore/` (Postgres-backed config)
- **duckdbservice/** — DuckDB Arrow Flight SQL service
  - Core: `service.go`, `flight_handler.go`, `arrow_helpers.go`, `auth.go`, `config.go`
  - Lifecycle, caching, profiling, metrics: `activation.go`, `transient.go`, `cache_proxy.go`, `profiling.go`, `progress.go`, `metrics.go`
- **transpiler/** — AST-based PostgreSQL → DuckDB SQL transpiler
  - Top-level: `transpiler.go`, `config.go`, `boolpredicates.go`, `show_create.go`
  - `transform/`: individual transforms; see registered pipeline in `transpiler.go` `New()`

## Run Modes

- **standalone** (default): Single process, handles everything including TLS, auth, PG protocol, and DuckDB execution.
- **control-plane**: Multi-process. Owns client connections end-to-end (TLS, auth, PG wire protocol, SQL transpilation, optional Flight SQL ingress) and routes queries to a worker pool.
  - **Process backend** (default, `--worker-backend process`): local Flight SQL workers over Unix sockets.
  - **Remote backend** (`--worker-backend remote`): per-org Kubernetes worker pods over TCP+TLS. Multitenant; requires `-tags kubernetes` and a Postgres-backed config store. Adds config store, org router, runtime tracker, janitor/leader election, and a provisioning/admin HTTP API.
- **duckdb-service**: Thin DuckDB execution engine exposed via Arrow Flight SQL. Spawned automatically by the control plane as worker processes, or run standalone for testing.

Key CLI flags for control-plane mode:
- `--mode control-plane|duckdb-service|standalone`
- `--worker-backend process|remote`
- `--process-min-workers N` / `--process-max-workers N`
- `--process-retire-on-session-end`
- `--worker-queue-timeout DURATION` / `--worker-idle-timeout DURATION`
- `--idle-timeout DURATION` — connection idle timeout: a client connection with no traffic for this long is closed and its worker released to hot-idle (in control-plane mode an idle connection otherwise pins a worker forever). **Control-plane default is `60s`** (`server.DefaultControlPlaneIdleTimeout`; standalone defaults to `24h`); a negative value disables it. `server.New` applies the standalone default, so the control plane sets it explicitly before `InitMinimalServer` (which skips that defaulting).
- `--memory-budget SIZE` (default 75% RAM) / `--memory-rebalance`
- `--socket-dir /path` (process backend)
- `--handover-drain-timeout DURATION` (default `24h` process; **remote default is `0` = unbounded** — the CP waits for active sessions for as long as it takes and the pod's k8s `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is the only hard wall. cloudflare/tableflip FD passing applies to process/standalone single-host upgrades, not k8s pod replacement.)
- `--flight-port N` (Arrow Flight SQL ingress) plus `--flight-session-idle-ttl`, `--flight-session-reap-interval`, `--flight-handle-idle-ttl`, `--flight-session-token-ttl`
- `--ducklake-delta-catalog-enabled` / `--ducklake-delta-catalog-path`
- Remote backend (requires `--config-store`; `-tags kubernetes` for K8s pool):
  - Config store: `--config-store`, `--config-poll-interval`, `--internal-secret`
  - K8s pool: `--k8s-worker-image`, `--k8s-worker-namespace`, `--k8s-control-plane-id`, `--k8s-worker-port`, `--k8s-worker-secret`, `--k8s-worker-configmap`, `--k8s-worker-image-pull-policy`, `--k8s-worker-service-account` (no global worker cap — per-org `Org.MaxWorkers`, 0=unbounded, is the only cap)
  - AWS / STS: `--aws-region`
  - Compute-usage billing needs no config: metering is always on for the remote backend and billing PULLS usage over the internal-secret-authed HTTP API (`GET /api/v1/billing/usage` + `POST /api/v1/billing/ack`). See `docs/design/billing-pull-api.md` and "Compute-Usage Billing" below.
  - Pod scheduling knobs (CPU/memory requests, node selector, tolerations) are env-only — see `config_resolution.go`.

Key CLI flags for duckdb-service mode:
- `--duckdb-listen` (e.g., `unix:///...` or `:8816`)
- `--duckdb-listen-fd` (internal; set by control plane)
- `--duckdb-token` (bearer auth)
- `--duckdb-max-sessions` (0=unlimited)

## Configuration

Configuration is resolved in `config_resolution.go` with the following precedence (highest to lowest):
1. CLI flags (`--port`, `--config`, etc.)
2. Environment variables (`DUCKGRES_PORT`, etc.)
3. YAML config file
4. Built-in defaults

Note: `--mode` is CLI-only (not loadable from YAML/env). A handful of K8s pod-scheduling knobs are env-only (no CLI flag).

## Keep docs in sync with behavior

When you change a behavior, default, flag, or invariant that is documented
anywhere in the repo, **update that documentation in the same PR.** Stale docs
are worse than no docs — they actively mislead the next reader (human or agent).
This applies to, at least: this `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`, CLI flag help
text (`main.go` / `cliflags.go`), and any design/plan docs that pin the changed
behavior. Concretely: if you change a default value, a flag's meaning, a drain or
shutdown semantic, an activation/routing/teardown order, or any of the
LOAD-BEARING CONTRACT sections below, grep for the old value/term across `*.md`
and help strings and fix every mention. A behavior change that leaves a doc
asserting the old behavior is incomplete, the same way a behavior change without
a test is incomplete.

## Development

The project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner. Run `just` to see all available recipes for building, testing, running, metrics, and scripts.

## Testing

**Every feature, behavior change, bugfix, AND refactor that affects runtime or
cluster behavior MUST ship with a solid end-to-end test case in
`tests/e2e-mw-dev/` (`harness.sh`).** This is not just for new features — any
change to how the system behaves at runtime (new capability, changed semantics,
a fixed bug, a new config knob, an activation/routing/teardown tweak) extends or
adds a harness assertion in the same PR. Refactors count too: when you move or
rewrite a code path the harness covers, confirm the relevant assertion still
exercises it (and update it if the path moved) — a refactor that quietly drops
e2e coverage is a regression in the test suite even if behavior is unchanged. Unit/package tests are necessary but not sufficient: a
change is only "done" once it is exercised against the real mw-dev cluster —
real worker pods, real Crossplane ducklings, real cnpg/RDS metadata, real
S3/STS. "Solid" means a deterministic pass/fail
assertion of the actual user-visible behavior (not just "it didn't error"), with
transient/cold-pool conditions handled, on both metadata backends (cnpg + ext)
where it touches metadata. A bugfix gets a regression assertion that would have
caught the bug. If a change genuinely cannot be asserted in-Job (e.g. it needs
cnpg-shards exec, or warm-pool-only state), say so explicitly in the
harness/README with the reason — don't silently skip. The harness is the gate
that catches what unit tests fake.

Three test lanes worth knowing about, in increasing order of blast radius:

- **Unit / package tests** (`go test ./...`): in-process, no external deps. Where most coverage lives. Includes `tests/manifests/` (static-manifest artifact asserts for `k8s/rbac.yaml` + `k8s/networkpolicy.yaml`).
- **`tests/integration/`** (`just test-integration`): spins up the standalone server binary against a real MinIO + Postgres metadata store via docker compose. Covers wire protocol, DuckLake on real S3-compatible storage, transpilation against a live server.
- **`tests/e2e-mw-dev/`** (per-PR GitHub workflow `e2e-mw-dev.yml`): the full multi-tenant activation pipeline against the **real posthog-mw-dev EKS cluster** — real Cilium, real Crossplane ducklings, real cnpg-shard + external-RDS metadata, real AWS S3. A shell harness (`harness.sh`) runs as an in-cluster Job per PR; `run.sh` orchestrates deploy/test/teardown/e2e-cleanup. **Replaces the retired kind suite** (`tests/k8s/`) — that suite's `k8s-integration-tests` CI job and its Go tests are gone; the supporting `k8s/` scripts/manifests + Dockerfiles are kept for now. See `tests/e2e-mw-dev/README.md`.

### When code changes obligate test changes

`tests/e2e-mw-dev/` is the only place we exercise the full activation pipeline (control plane → STS broker → worker pod → DuckDB → ATTACH against real cloud storage). If your change touches any of the following, treat updating the harness as part of the change, not a follow-up:

- `controlplane/shared_worker_activator.go`, `controlplane/sts_broker.go`, anything in the activation payload shape (`TenantActivationPayload`, `server.DuckLakeConfig`)
- `server/server.go::AttachDeltaCatalog`, `server.attachDuckLake*`, `server.refresh*Secret`
- `controlplane/configstore/models.go` — new columns flow through the provisioning API the harness calls; exercise them via a provision body field
- `duckdbservice/activation.go`, `worker_activation.go` — worker-side activation order
- Any code path that wires AWS credentials through to DuckDB SECRETs

The contract: if the harness no longer exercises a path you changed, **update `harness.sh`**; if your change removes a path it asserts against, **delete the assertion**. The DuckLake round-trip / durability / concurrent-writers checks in `harness.sh` are the load-bearing ones for catalog wiring — keep them honest.

## Dependencies

- `github.com/duckdb/duckdb-go/v2` - DuckDB Go driver
- `github.com/pganalyze/pg_query_go/v6` - PostgreSQL SQL parser (CGO, uses libpg_query)
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` - YAML config parsing

## Known Limitations

- No replication
- Some pg_catalog tables are stubs (return empty)
- Unmapped DuckDB types (MAP, STRUCT, UNION, ENUM, BIT) fall back to OidText
- DML RETURNING is not supported via extended query protocol (see below)

## DML RETURNING Detection

DML with RETURNING is rejected at extended-query Describe time with SQLSTATE `0A000` — the Describe path probes schema by executing the query, which would cause an unintended mutation. Detection lives in `isDMLReturning` and friends in `server/conn.go` (heuristic SQL-aware lexer, with any-depth scanning for WITH-prefixed writable CTEs). Invariants for anyone editing this code:

- **False negatives are dangerous** — they cause silent mutations during Describe. False positives are safe (just an error to the client). Err toward false positives.
- All detection is heuristic string scanning. If precision becomes critical, switch to `pg_query_go` AST parsing.
- LIMIT 0 does NOT prevent CTE side effects — Postgres CTEs are optimization fences, so writable CTEs execute even with LIMIT 0.
- DuckDB does not currently support MERGE. If it adds MERGE RETURNING, add `MERGE` to the prefix check in `isDMLReturning`.

## Worker Session Model (k8s / remote backend) — LOAD-BEARING CONTRACT

In the **control-plane remote/k8s backend** a worker pod serves **exactly one
client query session at a time**. This is deliberate: `workerDuckDBLimits`
(`controlplane/control.go`) gives the single session ~75% of the *whole pod's*
RAM + all CPU cores — it does NOT divide by session count. Two sessions on one
pod would each believe they own 75% → ~150% overcommit → nondeterministic OOM /
a heavy query killed by a co-resident one. Do not break the following:

- **One session per worker is enforced, not emergent.** The CP spawns remote
  worker pods with `DUCKGRES_DUCKDB_MAX_SESSIONS=1` (`k8s_pool.go::spawnWorker`).
  A 2nd concurrent `CreateSession` on a worker is rejected, not silently
  overcommitted. Internal control/maintenance work uses the worker's side
  connections (`controlDB`/`warmupDB`), which are NOT counted sessions — so
  cap=1 does not starve them. Do not raise this to >1 for k8s workers, and do not
  route internal work through `CreateSession`.
- **`OrgReservedPool` (remote/multitenant) must never co-assign.** It reuses only
  idle (`activeSessions==0`, Hot, org-owned) workers via
  `findIdleAssignedWorkerLocked`, or claims/spawns a fresh one. There is NO
  least-loaded "share onto a busy worker" path (that exists only in the
  single-tenant flat `K8sWorkerPool.AcquireWorker`, which is not used in remote
  mode). Do NOT add one, and do not resurrect a `leastLoaded*` helper here.
- **At org max workers + all busy → fail fast with the clear org-cap message**
  (`WorkerClaimMissReasonOrgCap`, see `capacity_policy.go`). Never busy-wait at cap.
- **Under cap → spawn a worker on demand** (`spawnReservedWorkerForSlot`). There
  is no warm pool to wait on; the cap is re-checked authoritatively cross-CP in
  `CreateSpawningWorkerSlot`. The spawn+activate runs DETACHED from the request
  ctx (`context.WithoutCancel` + `workerSpawnActivateTimeout`): the requester
  waits for the result or its own ctx, but a requester that gives up must NOT
  kill the in-flight pod (doomed-spawn thrash). An abandoned spawn that succeeds
  is parked hot-idle (`ReleaseWorker`/`TransitionToHotIdleIfNoSessions`, record
  persisted) for the org's next connection; one that fails is retired. Nothing
  may leak in Reserved/Activating.
- **FIFO anti-snatch:** the slow acquisition path's DECISION section (idle-reuse
  re-check → hot-idle claim → spawning-slot creation; `acquireDecision` in
  `org_reserved_pool.go`) is serialized per org by `orgAcquireGate`
  (`org_acquire_gate.go`) so a worker the CP scaled up for an earlier waiter
  cannot be snatched by a later connection. The multi-minute spawn+activate runs
  OUTSIDE the gate — each waiter is 1:1 bound to the claim/slot it owns and the
  session is pre-claimed before the worker becomes Hot, so a cold burst ramps N
  spawns in parallel without breaking anti-snatch. Keep the gate cancel-safe (a
  queued waiter whose ctx is cancelled must be skipped, not deadlock the gate).
- **Destroy-before-reuse ordering:** `SessionManager.DestroySession`
  (`session_mgr.go`) MUST await the worker-side `DestroySession` RPC *before*
  `ReleaseWorker`, so a reused (hot-idle) worker's prior session is gone before
  the next one is assigned (otherwise cap=1 spuriously rejects the reuse).
- **Cap-drift is recovered, not fatal:** if a worker still rejects a CP-scheduled
  session at its cap (CP↔worker accounting drift — should never happen),
  `SessionManager.CreateSessionWithProtocol` does NOT fail the client: it logs
  loudly (ERROR), bumps `duckgres_control_plane_worker_session_cap_drift_total`,
  retires (recycles) the inconsistent worker, and re-acquires a fresh one
  (bounded by `maxWorkerSessionCapDriftRetries`). Detection is
  `isWorkerSessionCapError` (matches the worker's "max sessions reached"
  message). A nonzero drift metric means the scheduling invariant is broken —
  fix the root cause, don't just lean on the retry.

Touching any of: `controlplane/org_reserved_pool.go`, `org_acquire_gate.go`,
`k8s_pool.go::spawnWorker`/`AcquireWorker`, `control.go::workerDuckDBLimits`, or
`duckdbservice` session counting → update the unit tests
(`org_reserved_pool_test.go`, `org_acquire_gate_test.go`,
`duckdbservice/service_test.go`) AND the `one_session_per_worker` +
`cold_burst_parallel_spawns` assertions in `tests/e2e-mw-dev/harness.sh`.

## Worker Drain Protocol (graceful shutdown, #690)

Remote worker pods drain on SIGTERM (pod deletion): they reject new work, keep
in-flight work alive, then exit; the CP marks them `Draining` (not crashed) and
retires them cleanly. Drain readiness is tracked by a refcount (`activeWork` in
`duckdbservice/service.go`) of "drain tokens" — one taken per unit of in-flight
work (query, txn, metadata stream, COPY, activation), released when it finishes.
Invariants: take exactly one token when work starts and release exactly one when
it ends on **every** path (a leak hangs drain to the shutdown timeout, an early
release lets shutdown kill live work); `reapIdle` releases tokens stranded by a
`GetFlightInfo` whose `DoGet` never arrived. `terminationGracePeriodSeconds=3600`
(`k8s_pool.go`) must stay above `workerShutdownDrainTime` (55m).

## User Persistent Secrets (multitenant remote backend)

`CREATE PERSISTENT SECRET` from a client survives across sessions and worker
pods: the CP intercepts it (`server/conn_user_secrets.go`, classification in
`server/usersecrets/`), executes it on the live session first (DuckDB
validates), then stores the statement AES-GCM-encrypted in the config store
(`duckgres_org_user_secrets`, keyed org/user/name) and replays it in the
`CreateSession` payload on the user's future sessions
(`duckdbservice/user_secrets.go`). Enabled by the env-only
`DUCKGRES_USER_SECRET_KEY` (base64 32-byte AES key); unset → clear 0A000
error. Plain/TEMPORARY `CREATE SECRET` stays session-scoped passthrough.
Invariants for anyone touching this path:

- **Cross-user isolation is the wipe at session create, not the destroy-time
  cleanup.** DuckDB secrets are instance-global, and a hot-idle worker is
  reused across users of an org: `wipeUserSecrets` drops ALL user-created
  secrets — persistent ones AND non-persistent (plain/TEMPORARY `CREATE
  SECRET`) ones, which pass through to the worker and would otherwise leak to
  the next user. It preserves only the system-managed allowlist
  (`usersecrets.IsReservedName`: `ducklake_s3`
  + the `__default_*`/`duckgres_*` prefixes, which activation re-creates). It
  MUST run before replay on every CreateSession in shared-warm mode, and a
  wipe failure MUST fail the session.
- **Execute-then-persist ordering.** Persist only statements DuckDB accepted;
  a store failure after a successful exec is an ERROR telling the user the
  secret will NOT survive the session. Replay failures at session create are
  warnings, never connection refusals.
- **No silent non-persistence.** Any path where persistent-secret DDL would
  execute but not persist must REJECT instead: multi-statement batches and
  parameterized statements (CP interception), and the Flight SQL ingress
  (`flightsqlingress.Config.RejectPersistentSecretDDL`). Otherwise the secret
  works for one session and is silently deleted by the next session's wipe.
- **DROP's store-fallback is gated on DuckDB's not-found error only**
  (`isSecretNotFoundError`). Any other exec failure (cancel, RPC error,
  ambiguity, aborted txn) must surface and leave the store untouched — a
  false "DROP succeeded" is fatal for a credential revocation.
- **Never log/store secret statement text.** `usersecrets.RedactForLog` guards
  logQueryStarted/Finished/Error, the query log, spans, and pg_stat_activity
  (`currentQuery`); keep new logging of query text behind it. Engine **error
  messages echo the offending SQL** (DuckDB emits `LINE 1: ... SECRET '...'`),
  so a failed CREATE SECRET leaks the credential via the `error` attribute /
  query-log `Exception` even when the query attribute is redacted —
  `usersecrets.RedactErrorForLog(query, errMsg)` guards those error sinks
  (logQueryError/logQueryFinished, `logQuery`); keep new error logging behind it
  too, and pass the original (un-redacted) query so it can classify.
- Touching the interception, wipe/replay, or payload shape → update
  `server/conn_user_secrets_test.go`, `duckdbservice/user_secrets_test.go`,
  and the `persistent_user_secret`(+`_isolation`) assertions in
  `tests/e2e-mw-dev/harness.sh`.

## Admin Console (VPC-private web UI, `kubernetes` tag)

`controlplane/admin/` serves a React admin console + REST API on `:8080` — the
operate-everything surface (metrics, live queries/sessions/connections, recent
errors, worker fleet, live cluster node/pod topology, full config store, user
impersonation, audit log; sliceable by org + user). Design + decisions:
`docs/design/admin-ui.md`; package details:
`controlplane/admin/README.md`. Exposed VPC-privately via an internal-scheme ALB
+ Cognito (Google SSO) behind Tailscale (charts: `ingress-admin.yaml`). Invariants:

- **Frontend is an embedded React/Vite SPA** (`ui/`, built to `ui/dist/`,
  `//go:embed all:ui/dist` in `embed_ui.go`, SPA-fallback served by Gin; the SPA
  owns `/`). `ui/dist` is a **gitignored build artifact** — only `ui/dist/.gitkeep`
  is tracked, so the embed has a target and `go build` compiles without node
  (the server then serves a "UI not built" notice). `just ui-build` builds it
  locally; both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.controlplane` run `npm run build`
  **before** `go build`. Do not delete `.gitkeep` and do not commit `ui/dist`.
- **Two-tier authz** (`authz.go`): `AuthMiddleware` resolves every `/api/v1`
  request to admin (valid `TokenSet` internal secret — service/break-glass) or to
  an SSO identity from the ALB `X-Amzn-Oidc-Data` JWT. The SSO email
  (`@posthog.com` + `email_verified != false`, else 401) is mapped to a role
  **per-request** by a `RoleResolver` backed by the `duckgres_operators` config-schema
  table (goose migration `000006_create_operators.sql`) — `admin` row → admin, else
  viewer. Admins manage operators
  under **Admin → Operators** (`/api/v1/operators`); the first SSO login
  auto-provisions a create-only **viewer** row, and the first admin is minted by
  logging in over the break-glass internal token and patching that row to `admin`
  under **Admin → Operators**. `RoleGate` requires admin for
  all mutating verbs + the audit GET. `AuditMiddleware` records every mutation.
  Keep new mutating routes under this gate; never add a write path that bypasses
  RoleGate/audit.
- **Impersonation is a real session** (`impersonate.go` + `admin_providers.go`):
  it reuses `SessionManager.CreateSessionWithProtocol` (workers trust the CP — no
  password) and **always** `DestroySession` in a defer. Admin-only, every
  statement audited with the admin actor + `usersecrets.RedactForLog` SQL; writes
  require `allow_write=true` (conservative classifier — WITH/CTEs count as
  writes). It consumes a worker under one-session-per-worker and counts against
  the org's connection limits — do not silently exempt it.
- **Metrics proxy is allow-listed** (`metrics_proxy.go`): the client passes a
  panel KEY, PromQL is built server-side from `rangePanels` (never an open PromQL
  relay) and forwarded to `DUCKGRES_PROMETHEUS_URL`. Org-labelled panels keep
  slicing enforced.
- **Env-only knobs**: `DUCKGRES_PROMETHEUS_URL` (read in
  `multitenant.go`; set by the chart). The audit table `duckgres_admin_audit` is
  AutoMigrated at startup (operational state, not goose-migrated tenant config).
  The `duckgres_operators` table is authoritative access-control data, so it lives
  in the config schema via goose migration `000006_create_operators.sql`, not
  AutoMigrate.
- `ManagedSession.Username` is populated at session create so the console can
  slice live sessions/queries by user; keep it set on every create path.
- **Errors page is a redacted, in-memory live-triage buffer** — NOT durable
  history. Every failed query is captured into a bounded per-server ring
  (`server/recent_errors.go`, `DefaultRecentErrorCap=500`) at the single
  `logQueryError` tap (`server/conn.go`), surfaced at `GET /api/v1/errors` and
  merged across CP replicas by `PeerFetcher.FetchPeers` (each error belongs to
  exactly one CP — disjoint union, no worker-id dedup; sorted newest-first, then
  capped). The ring stores ONLY the redacted forms: `Query` via
  `RedactForLog`, `Message` via `RedactErrorForLog` — a failed CREATE SECRET
  must never leak its credential into the ring. Keep the capture behind those
  redactors; long-term error history lives in the external query-log pipeline
  (Kafka sink), not here.
- **Per-user kill switch** (`live.go` routes + `admin_providers.go` +
  `session_mgr.go::DestroySessionsForUser` + `configstore` `disabled` column):
  - `POST …/users/:username/kill` is a **one-shot** terminate — it tears down all
    of a user's sessions + in-flight queries but does NOT block reconnects.
  - `POST …/users/:username/disable` is the **persistent block**: it sets the
    `duckgres_org_users.disabled` column (goose migration
    `000011_add_org_user_disabled.sql`), kills the user's live sessions, AND
    refuses the user's NEW connections at auth time on BOTH front-ends — PG wire
    (`control.go`, distinct `28000` "account is disabled" error, emitted only
    after the password checks out so it never leaks account existence) and Flight
    (`ConfigStore.ValidateOrgUser` / `ValidateOrgUserAndGetPassthrough` return
    false). `enable` reverses it. The disabled state is read from the in-memory
    snapshot, so disable/enable call `ConfigStore.ReloadSnapshot()` to make the
    flip effective immediately instead of one config-poll later.
  - These are **cluster-wide**: a user's sessions live on whichever CP replica
    owns each connection, so the handlers fan out the kill/disable/enable to peers
    via `PeerFetcher.PostPeers` (POST sibling of the read fan-out, same
    `?scope=local` recursion guard) and sum the per-CP `killed` counts. The
    snapshot reload is fanned out too so every replica enforces the block at once.
  - Kill must be **scoped to the target user** — never tear down another user's
    sessions on the shared org stack (the regression the e2e asserts with a
    concurrent root query that must survive).
- **Live Nodes view** (`ui/src/pages/Nodes.tsx` + `pages/nodes/peepernetes.{ts,css}`,
  a port of the standalone peepernetes visualizer): a full-bleed, animated
  cluster node/pod TV — nodes grouped by karpenter nodepool (or by namespace /
  deployment), CPU/MEM request bars, pod chips colored per deployment,
  placeholder/system-pod classification, Karpenter empty-node reclaim countdown,
  draining-duration on nodes (deletion-timestamp or client-tracked first-seen)
  and terminating-duration on pods, each pod's running image, unscheduled tray,
  and a synthesized event ticker. Its header carries only the filters; the
  cluster counters live in the shared admin **Topbar** and show on EVERY page —
  the Topbar polls `GET /cluster/summary` (`useClusterSummary`), a server-side
  aggregate (`cluster.go`) of nodes (duckgres nodepools) · CP replicas · running
  **workers** (label `app=duckgres-worker`, NOT every app pod — so it matches the
  worker chips + the CP's own worker accounting) with their vCPU/GiB request
  totals as a sub-line · **placeholders** with their vCPU/GiB and the cpu%/mem%
  those headroom pods are OF the worker totals · pending. Computing it server-side
  (not from the Nodes view's pushed counts) is what lets the totals appear on
  every page, not just while the view is mounted. The view has no separate live
  indicator — the Topbar's "Connected" dot (admin-API reachability) is the single
  green pulsing live signal. It's imperative DOM (mounted
  by the React page into a `.peeper` root, scoped CSS + `pn-`-prefixed keyframes)
  and does NOT use native K8s watch — the browser can't reach the API, so it
  POLLS four **read-only** projected endpoints (`server/`-free; `cluster.go`):
  `GET /cluster/{nodes,pods,events}` project the in-cluster objects down to the
  minimal K8s-shaped subset the view reads (annotations trimmed to
  `kubernetes.io/config.mirror`; no raw objects), and `GET /cluster/nodepools`
  proxies the karpenter NodePool CRD (v1→v1beta1, degrading to an empty list when
  karpenter is absent). Backed by the shared K8s pool's clientset
  (`Extras.ClusterClient`, nil on non-k8s backends → routes unregistered). All
  four are GETs so RoleGate admits viewers; there is no mutation path. **RBAC:**
  these reads are cluster-scoped / cross-namespace, which the CP's in-namespace
  Role doesn't cover — the grant lives on its own `duckgres-control-plane-cluster-topology`
  ClusterRole in the `charts` repo (`charts/duckgres/templates/rbac.yaml`), bound
  to the CP SA. It's a *separate* role (not folded into `duckgres-duckling-reader`)
  so binding duckling-reader elsewhere doesn't drag these broader reads along and
  trip RBAC escalation-prevention. When the ClusterRole is absent the handlers
  **degrade a Forbidden to an empty `{items:[]}` (200)** and log a warning, so the
  view shows nothing rather than 500ing — the e2e CP hits exactly this path (its
  SA can't be granted cluster-scoped RBAC from CI), so `admin_console_api` only
  asserts the `{items:[...]}` envelope; projection shape is covered by
  `cluster_test.go`. Touching
  the projection/endpoints or the view → update `controlplane/admin/cluster_test.go`
  and the `/cluster/{nodes,pods,events,nodepools}` checks in `admin_console_api`
  (`tests/e2e-mw-dev/harness.sh`).
- Touching any of the above → update `controlplane/admin/*_test.go` (esp
  `authz_test.go`, `kill_switch_test.go`), `controlplane/session_mgr_test.go`
  (`TestDestroySessionsForUser`), `controlplane/configstore/store_test.go`
  (`TestDisabledUserEnforcement`) AND the `admin_*` / `impersonation_*` /
  `user_kill_switch` / `user_disable_block` assertions in
  `tests/e2e-mw-dev/harness.sh`.

## Compute-Usage Billing (managed-warehouse, remote backend only)

duckgres meters per-org compute usage of worker pods into 60s buckets in the
config store; the billing service **pulls** the accumulated usage over an HTTP
API and acks a watermark, at which point duckgres deletes the acked buckets.
Full design + decisions: `docs/design/billing-pull-api.md` (supersedes the
push/capture reporting hop of `billing-compute-seconds-plan.md`; the metering
side of that doc still applies). Scope is **only** the remote/k8s backend
(per-org worker pod with a known `WorkerProfile` size). Pipeline:

```
compute: conn end → in-proc counter keyed (org, default team, query_source, worker size)
              │  flusher (~15s) UPSERT-increment → config-store buffer (cross-CP sum)
              ▼  duckgres_org_compute_usage (+ duckgres_compute_billing_cursor)
storage: leader sampler (~30m) → org's DuckLake metadata Postgres
              SUM(data+delete file sizes) × interval → duckgres_org_storage_usage
billing: GET /api/v1/billing/usage (usage + storage arrays, per key per UTC day, watermarks)
       → POST /api/v1/billing/ack {watermark_high} → cursor advance + delete ≤ it (BOTH tables)
safety:  leader-only GC hard-deletes buckets older than 30 days (WARN, alertable)
```

Two raw metrics per connection over its full lifetime, using the **provisioned**
worker size: `cpu_seconds = vCPU × ceil(conn_secs)`, `memory_seconds = GiB ×
ceil(conn_secs)`. Counted internally in integer **millicore-seconds** /
**MiB-seconds** (`compute_meter.go`) to avoid truncating a fractional-core /
sub-GiB worker; worker size is stored in the bucket key as exact NUMERIC
decimals (vCPU / GiB). `team_id` is the org's `default_team_id` (an integer —
PostHog's `Team.id`; a JSON NUMBER on every API surface, BIGINT in the config
store, 0 = "no default team"; resolved from the config snapshot at connection
end); `query_source` is the
`duckgres.query_source` session GUC (`standard` unless set; a mid-connection
change bills the whole connection under the final value). Invariants for anyone
touching this path:

- **Metering is strictly best-effort and off the hot path.** A metering error
  (counter, flush) must NEVER block or fail a query or connection teardown. The
  connection-end record is added to an in-process counter (map+mutex,
  microseconds, no I/O); the flush is async. `cp.computeMeter` is nil outside
  the remote backend — every call site is nil-safe. There is no enable knob:
  the remote backend always meters.
- **Worker size is plumbed onto the connection** (`server.SetConnectionWorkerSize`
  → `clientConn.workerMillicores/workerMiB`, set in `control.go::handleConnection`
  from `workerBillingSize(workerProfile)`, remote-only). `workerMillicores==0`
  (non-remote / unknown) → metering skipped. The metric is computed once at the
  SAME teardown point as `CloseConnectionMetrics` (the `#841` lifetime defer),
  via `server.ConnectionBilling` (which also carries the query source).
- **Bucket = connection-end time floored to 60s.** Flush carries the sub-unit
  remainder forward so rounding never loses counts across flushes. Buffer flush
  is UPSERT-increment so all CP pods sum into one row per key.
- **Serve only closed buckets.** `watermark_high` = the newest bucket with
  `bucket_start ≤ now − 60s − 30s grace` (grace > flush interval, so every
  CP's contribution has landed before a minute is served). The GET aggregates
  the window `(cursor, watermark_high]` into one row per
  `(org, team, query_source, cpu, mem_gib)` per **UTC day** — response size is
  bounded by active keys × days, so billing downtime can't make it explode.
- **Ack is the only deletion path (plus the 30d GC).** `POST /billing/ack`
  advances the single global cursor monotonically and deletes buckets
  `≤ watermark_high` in one TXN (`AckComputeUsage`). Idempotent — re-acks and
  stale acks are no-ops. An ack beyond the latest closed bucket is rejected
  (400) so it can never delete buckets that were never served. Auth is the
  admin internal secret (`RequireAdmin` on both routes, registered inside the
  audited `/api/v1` group in `multitenant.go`).
- **Safety GC is leader-only** (`runComputeUsageGC`, attached under the janitor
  lease): hard-deletes buckets older than 30 days regardless of ack and logs a
  WARN with the dropped count — nonzero means billing stopped pulling (alert).
- **Graceful shutdown does a final flush** after connections drain to their
  natural end (`shutdown`/`drainAndShutdown`), so a departing CP pod lands its
  last interval before exit.
- **Storage metric** (`managed_warehouse_storage_gib_seconds`,
  `storage_meter.go`): a LEADER-ONLY sampler (double writers would
  double-bill — the UPSERT is additive) visits each Ready warehouse's DuckLake
  metadata Postgres every 30m (env-only `DUCKGRES_STORAGE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL`;
  e2e uses 60s) and credits exactly `tracked_bytes × interval` byte-seconds —
  no elapsed-time tracking, a missed sample under-bills one interval. The SUM
  is over `ducklake_data_file` + `ducklake_delete_file` with NO snapshot
  filter (never `ducklake_table_info()`/`ducklake_table_stats` — current-
  snapshot-only / approximate). byte-seconds are NUMERIC (BIGINT overflows);
  served as exact-decimal GiB-seconds (÷2³⁰ terminates;
  `byteSecondsToGiBSeconds` big-int math). Connection resolution reuses the
  cross-org activator (`MetadataPostgresURL`: duckling pgbouncer → sslmode
  disable, direct RDS → require). Drift gauges:
  `duckgres_org_storage_pending_delete_files` (alert on sustained nonzero) +
  `duckgres_org_storage_tracked_bytes`.
- Touching the meter/flush/API/GC, the worker-size or query-source plumbing,
  the storage sampler, or the bucket keys → update
  `controlplane/compute_meter_test.go`, `compute_billing_api_test.go`,
  `compute_size_test.go`, `storage_meter_test.go`,
  `configstore/storage_usage_test.go`, the migration assertion in
  `tests/configstore/migrations_postgres_test.go`, and the
  `compute_usage_pull_api` assertion (compute + storage) in
  `tests/e2e-mw-dev/harness.sh`.

## Resharding (metadata-store migrations) — LOAD-BEARING CONTRACT

Operator-driven moves of an org's DuckLake catalog between metadata stores
(cnpg↔cnpg, ext→cnpg, cnpg→ext escape hatch), admin-console-driven with a
verbose op log. Full design: `docs/design/resharding.md`. Pieces:
`configstore/reshard.go` (+ migration `000018`),
`provisioner/reshard_runner.go` + `catalog_copy.go`, `admin/reshard.go`, UI
`ReshardForm.tsx`/`ReshardOperation.tsx`. Invariants:

- **The sound connection barrier is the lease-GRANT check**, not the
  connect-time 57P03 gates: the grant transaction refuses `resharding` orgs
  under the same per-org advisory lock `SetWarehouseResharding` takes for the
  `ready→resharding` CAS. Never rely on the snapshot-polled connect gate
  alone — a lease can be granted up to a queue-timeout after it ran.
- **Drain, never kill**: live queries always finish. Drain = leases==0 AND
  queue==0 (one tx) AND zero live org workers (each runs a catalog-writing
  `DuckLakeCheckpointer`). Lingering hot-idle workers are retired via the
  standard CAS retire path only — never raw pod deletes. Parked reconnectable
  Flight sessions are destroyed locally per CP (they'd hold leases ~1h).
- **Flip semantics differ by direction**: a `cnpgShard` change re-points
  role/DB in place (source ORPHANED — explicit cleanup after verify); a TYPE
  flip to external makes Crossplane DELETE the cnpg role/DB → cnpg→ext runs
  **copy-before-flip** (the flip IS the cleanup, only after verify).
  **External stores are never modified/deleted.**
- **Rollback patches the source shard VALUE back — never removes the key**
  (precedence would fall through to the freshly-stamped bogus status pin);
  ext→cnpg rollback must null `cnpgShard` (XRD CEL forbids it on external).
- **The ext target password is ephemeral**: request → in-process stash →
  runner memory; never in the op row, log, or audit. Takeover mid-copy fails
  with a clear re-run message instead of proceeding without it.
- **The ext SM secret must be ESO-readable and a raw string**: the ESO IAM
  policy only allows `posthog-*`/`duckling-*` names (RDS-managed
  `rds!…`/`rds/…/master` secrets never work → start handler 400s them,
  `rdsManagedSecretNamePattern`), and the composition's ExternalSecret copies
  the whole value verbatim (no JSON property). An unreadable name that slips
  through just hangs the cutover wait until the per-op timeout, then recovers
  (flip-back + copy-back). The form teaches the same rules
  (`ui/src/lib/reshard.ts::classifySecretName`).
- **Runner fencing**: claim bumps `runner_epoch`; every runner write is
  CAS-fenced on (runner, epoch); stale-heartbeat (>5m) ops are takeover-able;
  the copy holds a target-DB advisory lock.
- Touching any of this → update `tests/configstore/reshard_postgres_test.go`,
  `provisioner/reshard_runner_test.go`, `admin/reshard_test.go`, the
  migration asserts in `tests/configstore/migrations_postgres_test.go`, AND
  the `reshard_*` assertions in `tests/e2e-mw-dev/harness.sh` (validation,
  cancel-during-drain, bogus-shard-rollback, ext→cnpg positive path).
  cnpg→ext positive path is unit-only (harness lacks the RDS password);
  cnpg→cnpg positive path needs a second mw-dev shard (follow-up).

## TODO Reference

`TODO.md` is a lightweight backlog for ideas that do not yet have a better
home. It is not the PostgreSQL compatibility source of truth; use
`docs/postgres-compatibility.md` for compatibility status, test citations, and
